# Express Pokedex

Working with databases, especially through ORMs, can present quite a learning curve. We'll start by incorporating one database model into an application to save favorite Pokemon.

#### Backstory: Pokemon

If you're not familiar with Pokemon, Pokemon is a franchise/universe created by Satoshi Tajiri in 1995. It's a famous franchise in both the US and Japan. Fun facts:

* Pokemon is short for "Pocket Monsters"
* The Pokemon universe extends to games, trading cards, and TV
* [The Pokemon Company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pok%C3%A9mon_Company) is headquartered in Bellevue, WA.

## Getting Started

We'll be using an existing application that uses the [PokeAPI](http://pokeapi.co/), a Pokemon API that allows us to get a list of Pokemon.

* Fork and clone this repository
* Run `npm install` to install dependencies
  * Use `nodemon` to start the server

#### Read the Code

* After setup, **STOP**. You're using an existing application, so make sure to read the code and ensure what the application does. Some questions you may want to ask yourself:
  * How does the app retrieve a list of Pokemon?
  * How many Pokemon does the API call retrieve? Why that many?
  * What are the routes defined in the application?
  * Try adding a Pokemon to your favorites.
    * How is this data being submitted?
    * What will you have to do to save this data to a database?
    * What will you have to do to display favorite Pokemon?

## User Stories

* As a user, I want to select my favorite Pokemon and add them to a list of favorites.
* As a user, once I add a Pokemon to my list of favorites, I want to be redirected to my favorites page.

## Requirements

#### Part 1: Setup Database

Your first step will be to create a SQL database for your application as well as corresponding setup and seed files. Refer back to the notes as necessary.

#### Part 2: Create a Pokemon Table

Your second step will involve writing a SQL setup file to create a SQL table in your database to store your favorite Pokemon. It's recommended that you name this table `pokemon`. It will only store one attribute, the Pokemon's `name`.

Once you have created the setup file, run the file against your database to create your tables. (This of course, can be done directly in psql/postico if you wish.) Then be sure to test connectivity to and the functionality of your database. This can be done in a separate file. An example:

**dbTest.js**

```js
var db = require('./models')

db.pokemon.create({
  name: 'Bulbasaur',
  pokedex: 1
})
.then(function(){
  console.log('success')
})
.catch(function(err){
  console.log('Uh-oh', err)
})
```

Be sure to also test querying against the pokemon table.

#### Part 3: Integrating the database with the app

You'll want to add functionality to the following routes by incorporating the `pokemon` table you created.

* `GET /pokemon`
  * View: `views/pokemon/index.ejs`
  * Purpose: Retrieve all favorited Pokemon and display them on the page
* `POST /pokemon`
  * View: none (redirect to `/pokemon`)
  * Purpose: Creates a new Pokemon and redirects back to `/pokemon`

#### Part 4: Styling

When finished with the above, style the application appropriately with CSS.

## Bonuses

* Add the ability to DELETE Pokemon from the favorites list.
* For each Pokemon on the favorites page, create a show page to display additional information about that Pokemon.
  * You'll need to create an additional route.
  * You can get detailed information about a Pokemon by passing the Pokemon's name to PokeAPI. You can retrieve images, abilities, stats, and moves through the API.
  * Example: http://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/bulbasaur/
